📌 Project Overview
This project performs a data-driven exploration of how Artificial Intelligence is reshaping industries and economies globally. Using a dataset covering 200 observations across multiple countries (including the USA, China, India, and France), this analysis evaluates the relationship between AI adoption, workforce displacement, revenue growth, and consumer trust.

📊 Key Insights & Features
Industry Deep-Dives: Analyzes AI's footprint in sectors like Healthcare, Media, Manufacturing, Legal, and Gaming.

Adoption vs. Impact: Investigates how high AI adoption rates correlate with revenue increases and job loss percentages.

Tool Ecosystem: Tracks the usage of leading AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion.

Regulatory Landscape: Visualizes the distribution of regulation statuses (Strict, Moderate, Lenient) across different nations.

Human-AI Synergy: Measures the "Human-AI Collaboration Rate" to understand how workforce roles are evolving rather than just disappearing.
